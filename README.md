MICROBLX: hard realtime, embedded, reflective function blocks
=============================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kmarkus/microblx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kmarkus/microblx)

What is it?
-----------

Microblx is an lightweight, dynamic, reflective, hard realtime safe
function block framework. Primary use-cases are hard realtime
(embedded) control or signal processing applications.

Main features:

 - Core in C, few external dependencies
 - No code generation, dynamic type handling
 - Lua scripting for system configuration and deployment
 - C, C++ or Lua support for implementing function blocks
 - Standard function block and type library
 - Webinterface function block to introspect and control blocks
 - Automatic block stub code generation
 - Generic Lua scriptable function block
 - Similar to IEC-61508 and IEC-61499 functions blocks


Dependencies
------------

 - uthash (apt: `uthash-dev`)
 - luajit (>=v2.0.0) (apt: `luajit` and `libluajit-5.1-dev`) (not
   strictly required, but recommended)
 - `uutils` Lua modules [github](https://github.com/kmarkus/uutils)
 - `liblfds` lock free data structures (v6.1.1) [github](https://github.com/liblfds/liblfds6.1.1)
 - `lua-unit` (apt: `lua-unit`, src:
   [luaunit](https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit) (to run the tests)
 - gcc or clang
 - only for development: `cproto` (apt: `cproto`) to generate C prototype header file
 - autotools etc. (apt: `automake`, `libtool`, `pkg-config`, `make`)

Building and setting up
------------------------

### Using yocto

The best way to use microblx on an embedded system is by using the
[meta-microblx](https://github.com/kmarkus/meta-microblx) yocto
layer. Please see the README in that repository for further steps.

### Building manually

Building to run locally on a PC.

Before building microblx, liblfds611 needs to be built and
installed. There is a set of patches in the microblx repository to
clean up the packaging of liblfds. Follow the instructions below:

Clone the code:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/liblfds/liblfds6.1.1.git
$ git clone https://github.com/kmarkus/microblx.git
$ git clone https://github.com/kmarkus/uutils.git
```

First build lfds:

```
$ cd liblfds6.1.1
$ git am ../microblx/liblfds/*.patch
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Then install `uutils`:

```bash
$ cd ../uutils
$ sudo make install
```

Now build microblx:

```bash
$ cd ../microblx
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Run the example system:

```bash
$ ubx_ilaunch -webif -c /usr/share/microblx/examples/systemmodels/trig_rnd_hexdump.usc
```
browse to http://localhost:8888 to inspect the system.

License
-------

See COPYING. The microblx core is licensed under the weak copyleft
Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (MPL-2.0). Standard blocks are
mostly licensed under the permissive BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised"
License or also under the MPLv2.

It boils down to the following. Use microblx as you wish in free and
proprietary applications. You can distribute binary function blocks
modules. Only if you make changes to the core files (mostly the files
in libubx/) library), and distribute these based on these, then you
are required to release these under the conditions of the MPL-2.0.


Acknowledgement
---------------

Microblx is considerably inspired by the OROCOS Real-Time
Toolkit. Other influences are the IEC standards covering function
block IEC-61131 and IEC-61499.
